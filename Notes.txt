Just create a plain angular app without dotnet.

--these are already part of package.json otherwise we could add to the sh file.
npm install --save-dev run-script-os
npm i @angular-devkit/build-angular

Running the Gui app from VSCode debugger doesn't work.
Do dotnet run from the Gui folder.
Use npx kill-port 44410 if the port gets stuck.
